This project proposal aims to leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to predict credit card approvals accurately. By harnessing historical data and utilizing advanced analytics, 
the proposed model intends to streamline the credit evaluation process, leading to quicker decisions, reduced manual workload, and improved risk management. The predictive model will be 
designed to analyze a range of features, encompassing financial histories, demographics, and transaction patterns, to ascertain the likelihood of an applicant's credit card approval.

This project uses techniques like Data cleaning, feature selection, imputation, feature extraction, and feature encoding using Label Encoder and MinMaxScaler, training the dataset and 
analyzing the accuracy, recall and precision of various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost and Random Forest and also using Cross Validation techniques to increase 
the accuracy.
